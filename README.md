# The background

I like to play squash, but renting a racket everytime amounts to a lot of money, so I bought me a pretty decent squash racket. It's an investment, so when it returns?

# The idea

I want to keep track of each and every "payoff" of an single "investment", so I know when the COST is RETURNED.

# The requirements

- Handle multiple users
- Handle multiple "investments"
- Sharing "investment" progress via magic links 

# The structure

- Frontend: SolidJS with TailwindCSS & DaisyUI, w a c k y  a n i m a t i o n s
- Backend: Flask - a one-file proxy, with one custom endpoint (for login)
- Database: Pocketbase

# The details
